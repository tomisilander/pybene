- do not optimize

- implement Bayesian scores and NML scores
- implement constraints
- implement model-averaging
 
- create image

# to cut a part X of the network to be optimized, one strategy is to 
# to fix the inside parents of the nodes in X and not allow any new parents to them
# for this one needs to implement constraints

- plan cutting and how to use it
  - Take a big network
  - cut a piece (remember the mapping between cut and orig variables)
  	- by selecting a node and its boundary and its boundary etc.
  - optimize a piece
  - glue the piece back
    - for each node in a piece choose between its new parents and old ones 
    - BUT can you do that without creating cycles?
      -NO YOU CANNOT
