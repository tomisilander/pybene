- if called for selected vars - no need to gather all local scores !!! 
- in general - need work to support using a subset of variables
- do not optimize

- implement Bayesian scores and NML scores
- implement model-averaging
 
- create image

# to cut a part X of the network to be optimized, one strategy is to 
# to fix the inside parents of the nodes in X and not allow any new parents to them
# for this one needs to implement constraints

- plan cutting and how to use it
  - Take a big network
  - cut a piece == set of disjoint subsets (remember the mapping between cut and orig variables)
  	- by selecting a node and its boundary and its boundary etc.
    - and restarting from a random node if piece does not have enough nodes 
  - optimize a piece
    - fix the parents of variables that do have parents outside the piece
  - glue the piece back
